# UART
A Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) is a block of 
circuitry responsible for implementing serial communication,UART is Full Duplex protocol (data transmission in both directions simultaneously),Transmitting UART converts parallel data from the master device (eg. 
CPU) into serial form and transmit in serial to receiving UART ,Receiving UART will then convert the serial data back into parallel data 
for the receiving device
